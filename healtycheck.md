Configure Healthchecks
Railway provides controls for ensuring newly deployed services only receive traffic after they are healthy.

Configure The Healthcheck Path
A Healthcheck can be used to guarantee zero-downtime deployments of your web services by ensuring the new version is live and able to handle requests.

To configure a healthcheck:

Ensure your webserver has an endpoint (e.g. /health) that will return an HTTP status code of 200 when the application is live and ready.

Under your service settings, input your health endpoint. Railway will wait for this endpoint to serve a 200 status code before switching traffic to your new endpoint

Note: Railway does not monitor the healthcheck endpoint after the deployment has gone live.

Configure The Healthcheck Port
Railway will inject a PORT environment variable that your application should listen on.

This variable's value is also used when performing health checks on your deployments.

If your application doesn't listen on the PORT variable, possibly due to using target ports, you can manually set a PORT variable to inform Railway of the port to use for health checks.

Menu Variables > Port 3000 > add button

Not listening on the PORT variable or omitting it when using target ports can result in your health check returning a service unavailable error.

Healthcheck Timeout
The default timeout on healthchecks is by default 300 seconds (5 minutes) - if your application fails to serve a 200 status code during this allotted time, the deploy will be marked as failed.

To increase the timeout, change the number of seconds on the service settings page, or with a RAILWAY_HEALTHCHECK_TIMEOUT_SEC service variable.

Services with Attached Volumes
To prevent data corruption, we prevent multiple deployments from being active and mounted to the same service. This means that there will be a small amount of downtime when re-deploying a service that has a volume attached, even if there is a healthcheck endpoint configured.

Healthcheck Hostname
Railway uses the hostname healthcheck.railway.app when performing healthchecks on your service. This is the domain from which the healthcheck requests will originate.

For applications that restrict incoming traffic based on the hostname, you'll need to add healthcheck.railway.app to your list of allowed hosts. This ensures that your application will accept healthcheck requests from Railway.

If your application does not permit requests from that hostname, you may encounter errors during the healthcheck process, such as "failed with service unavailable" or "failed with status 400".

Continuous Healthchecks
The healthcheck endpoint is currently not used for continuous monitoring as it is only called at the start of the deployment, to ensure it is healthy prior to routing traffic to it.
